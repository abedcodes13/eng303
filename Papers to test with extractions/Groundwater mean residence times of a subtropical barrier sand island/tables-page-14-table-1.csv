H. Hofmann et al.: Groundwater mean residence times of a subtropical barrier sand island"
"Figure 9. Conceptual sketch of groundwater ﬂow across the island from the centre of the island to the ocean in the east and to Moreton Bay in"
"the west. Parts of the centrally recharged groundwater also ﬂow to the north and the south (Leach and Gallagher, 2013). Lower-permeability"
"units in the unsaturated zone can have longer residence times than direct recharge. There may also be groundwater contributions from the"
"bedrock. On the western side, some of the groundwater is discharged directly into Moreton Bay, while some ﬂows underneath the tidal mud"
"ﬂats in semi-conﬁned conditions and is discharged partly through wonky holes into the bay."
