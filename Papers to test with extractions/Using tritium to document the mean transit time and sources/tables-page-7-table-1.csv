Sources of groundwater inﬂows"
"Despite their only being a few groundwater samples, the major"
"ion geochemistry of the groundwater from the different aquifers is"
"similar, and the groundwater geochemistry is similar to that of the"
"river water (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3). As discussed above, the simi-"
"larity of
the major
ion geochemistry between groundwater and"
"river water was one of the lines of evidence that is consistent with"
"Deep
Creek

inﬂows
(Cartwright
and"
"Gilfedder, 2015). The major ion geochemistry cannot, however, be"
"used to determine from where the groundwater is derived. Like-"

"aquifers are similar and overlap with those of the least evaporated"
"river water (Fig. 4). As with the major ion geochemistry, these data"
"are consistent with there being groundwater inﬂows to Deep Creek"
"but do not indicate from where in the aquifer system the ground-"
"water is derived."
"By contrast, the observation that the regional groundwater has"
"signiﬁcantly lower
<s>3</s>Hactivities(<0.84 TU)
than the river water"
"(1.47e2.91 TU) implies that it does not contribute signiﬁcantly to"
"the river, even when Deep Creek comprises a series of disconnected"
"pools. Two end-member models that may be used to estimate the"
"contribution of groundwater of different ages to the river are: 1) the"
"discharge of groundwater with a continuum of transit times; and 2)"
