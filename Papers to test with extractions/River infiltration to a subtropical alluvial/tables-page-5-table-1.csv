"2.3. Environmental Tracer Sampling"
"Groundwater was sampled from the piezometer network on four occasions (November 2009, November"
"2010, April 2011, and November 2011). These corresponded to the end of a prolonged base ﬂow period"
"during a drought
(November 2009), a bank full ﬂow following drought-breaking rains (November 2010), a"
"ﬂow recession (April 2011), and another base ﬂow period (November 2011; Figure 4a). On each sampling"
"trip, manual water levels in each piezometer were taken before they were purged for three bore volumes."
"Special care was taken to locate the pump head at least 1 m above the top of the screen and to purge piez-"
"ometers slowly to avoid dewatering at the screen level."
"Electrical conductivity, pH, and temperature were measured in the ﬁeld under ﬂowing water using cali-"
"brated probes. Dissolved oxygen was
also measured in
the
ﬁeld
using
a Winkler
titration
test.
For"
"major
ions
and stable
isotopes of water, water
samples were
0.45 mm ﬁltered in a
ﬁeld laboratory"
"soon after
collection.
Stable
isotope of water
samples were
stored inverted in a gas-tight
collection"
"vessel
(McCartney bottle). For major cations, 50 mL samples were stored in well-rinsed PET bottles and"
"acidiﬁed to pH < 2. For major anions, pH and alkalinity, ﬁltered samples were stored in a similar
fash-"
"ion but without acidiﬁcation. Water

"glass
jars ﬁlled from the bottom and allowed to overﬂow for 5 min. For noble gases, equilibrium head"
"space samples were collected using passive diffusion samplers
[Gardner and Solomon, 2009]. Diffusion"
"samplers were
allowed to equilibrate with sample water
(i.e.,
immersed in the piezometer
at
screen"
"level or
in the river)
for 24 h,
retrieved and clamped vacuum tight. Water
for

"collected in 1 and 5 L polyethylene bottles,
respectively.
In addition to samples
collected during the"
"four
sampling trips, between August 2010 and December 2011, weekly
river
samples were
collected"
"for chloride concentration and the stable isotopes of water at Narrabri
(at
the NSW river
stage Station"
"419003)."
"2.4. Analytical Procedures"
"Laboratory electrical conductivity (Meterlab CDM 230) and pH were measured with calibrated probes in a"
"constant temperature room. Total alkalinity was measured by titration to a pH 4.5 end point. Major cations"
"were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (Spectro ARCOS) and anions"
"by ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-2500). All major ion analyses were performed at the CSIRO Waite Cam-"
"pus Analytical Services Unit
(Australia). The isotope ratios of water were measured by isotope ratio mass"
"spectrometry (Europa Geo 20-20) using the Water Equilibration System (WES)
technique or
the uranium"
"reduction method. The latter
