for an exploited, subtropical alluvial aquifer (Lower Namoi River, New South Wales, Australia). A"
"particular emphasis was to evaluate if environmental age tracers can be used to estimate inﬁltration rates in"
"this environment. The Lower Namoi Alluvium is one of the most heavily exploited groundwater resources in"
"Australia, resulting in the Lower Namoi River having been a losing system for several decades prior to the"

"but, because of high inﬁltration rates,
to remain relatively young (<30 years).
