In the simplest cases of
the Piston Flow Model
(PM) and"
"the Linear Model
(LM), the groundwater sample is assumed to have a unique source and age or a constant"
"age distribution over a deﬁned period, respectively.
In more complex cases,
like the Exponential Model (EM)"
"and the Gamma Model (GM), the groundwater sample is assumed to include water from a range of sources"
"each with its own age [Maloszewski and Zuber, 1982; Kirchner et al., 2000]. The main advantages of
lumped"
"parameter models over more complex numerical solute transport models are that they are nondimensional"
"and few parameters need to be ﬁtted. However,
lumped parameter models assume that ﬂow is constant"
"and that the underlying age-distribution of groundwater is known."
"Here we also use the more ﬂexible Dispersion Model
(DM) to explore the properties of the aquifer. The DM"
"is similar to the advection-dispersion solute transport model. The parameters to be ﬁtted are MRT and the"
"Peclet number (Pe; the ratio of advective to dispersive transport in the aquifer). The PF and EM are special"
"cases of the DM where the Peclet number is either very large or very small, respectively. The input functions"
