"area."
"the Namoi Region and groundwater pumping accounts for 49% of water use, primarily for cotton irrigation."
"The study area is located in the Lower Namoi Alluvium approximately 12 km downstream of
the town of"
"Narrabri, and consists of two riparian piezometer transects (Old Mollee and Yarral East) approximately 2 km"
"apart (Figure 1). The Lower Namoi Alluvium can be up to 120 m thick and consists of the shallow Narrabri"
"Formation, the deeper Gunnedah Formation and,
locally, a deeper paleochannel deposit (Cubbaroo Forma-"
"tion) [CSIRO, 2007]. The alluvium overlies the eastern edge of the Coonamble Embayment of the Great Arte-"
"sian Basin (GAB) [Smerdon et al., 2012] (Figure 2)."
"Each transect consisted of three pairs of nested piezometers and a surface water gauge (Figure 3). At each"
"transect, one nest was installed as close to the river as practical
(that is, on a river bench at Old Mollee and"
"at the top of the bank at Yarral East) and the others up to 300 m further away in the ﬂoodplain. The down-"
"stream Yarral East was in a grazing paddock overlooking a steep bank, while Old Mollee was on a reserve"
"(public park) with a more extensive coverage of riparian trees.
In a nest, each piezometer was installed sin-"
"gly (that
is, had its own hole) using cable tool drilling, which minimized the introduction of contaminants"
"into the aquifer. The piezometers consisted of 95 mm diameter class 12 PVC in glued lengths, a 2 m length"
"screen (1 mm slots), and a 1 m sump. The annulus was backﬁlled with waterworn rounded gravels, sealed"
"with bentonite, and grouted to ground level. Each piezometer was protected at the surface by a 2 m lock-"
"able steel casing (in two 1 m sections) bolted into a cement base. At each nest, one screen was located"
"(cid:3)4–5 m and the other (cid:3)10 m below the water table under base ﬂow conditions. Below a silt veneer on the"
"ﬂoodplain, the aquifer material was a mixture of sand and gravel units, with some clay at depth (Figure 3)."
"The location of piezometers, surface water gauging stations, and a proﬁle of the land surface and riverbed"
"elevation were surveyed relative to the Australian Height Datum (AHD; similar to mean sea level)."
"2.2. Water Level and Piezometric Surface Monitoring"
"River stage and groundwater levels were monitored at 15 min intervals for various periods between March"
"2009 and November 2011 using unvented pressure transducers (Mini-Diver; Schlumberger Water Services)."
"A barometric pressure logger with the same technical speciﬁcations was deployed in one of the piezome-"
"ters at each transect to convert absolute pressures into hydraulic heads. The loggers were downloaded and"
