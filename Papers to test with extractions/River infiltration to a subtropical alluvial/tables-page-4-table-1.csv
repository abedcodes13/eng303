"screen, the water levels at November 2009, and the texture of aquifer material from borehole logs. At each piezometer nest, the water"
"level on the left is for the deeper piezometer and the one on the right is for the shallower piezometer. Note that the piezometer nest clos-"
"est to the river at Old Mollee is on a bench rather than on top of the bank."
"water levels measured manually quarterly. While river stage was measured at both sites (Namoi River at Gal-"
"atheria, NSW Station 419100 and Namoi River at Yarral East, NSW Station 419101), these stations were only"
"operational between March 2009 and November 2009, after which they were damaged by a stormﬂow in"
"January 2010. However, an existing river gauge was also present at Old Mollee (Namoi River at Old Mollee,"
"NSW Station 419139) and has a continuous record. An estimate of river stage for Yarral East was obtained"
"by adjusting stage at Station 419139 to the stage differences observed between Stations 419100 and"
"419101 (22.1 m) when both were active. Groundwater
levels were measured between March 2009 and"
"March 2010 in all piezometers and,
in selected piezometers, between March 2011 and November 2011."
"However, even within these periods,
the record in some piezometers was incomplete due to equipment"
"failure."
