"4. Discussion"
"Alluvial aquifers are among the most heavily exploited groundwater
resources and there is considerable"
"interest
to understand their connectivity with rivers [Brunner et al., 2009; Eastoe et al., 2010; Lamontagne"
"et al., 2014].
Inﬁltration processes can often only be approximately represented in regional groundwater"
"models [Brunner et al., 2010; Rassam, 2011], and key system properties,
like the hydraulic conductivity of the"
"riverbed, are usually not known [Rassam et al., 2008]. Thus,
independent estimates of river inﬁltration rates"
"may improve the calibration of the models used to manage alluvial groundwater resources. Here a section"
"of the Namoi River was instrumented with a purpose-built riparian piezometer network to evaluate if envi-"
"ronmental age tracers can be used to provide an independent estimate of inﬁltration rates in exploited sub-"
"tropical
aquifers.
